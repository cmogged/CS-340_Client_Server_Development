# CS-340_Client_Server_Development

#### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) python module helps programmatically connect and interact with a mongoDB database. This simple python module can be reused to manage any such databases which can occupy many servers.

#### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

MongoDB includes methods for programming and filtering information much like other programming languages which would be familiar to computer scientists. I think a good strategy is to play it safe and always get familiar with the tools you are using before you use them.

#### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists can break down the workings of systems and structures to their fundamental components or build from them. This is useful for companies as they often rely on modular components that require them to work well together.
